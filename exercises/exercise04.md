# Exercise 04: Advanced SQL, Jupyter, and Visualization

- Name:Blessing Aganaga
- Course: Database for Analytics
- Module:
- Database Used: World Database
- Tools Used: PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebooks

---

## Instructions

- Complete each task using the **World database** installed earlier.
- For SQL questions:
  - Write the SQL command in a fenced code block
  - Execute the command and include a **screenshot of the results**
- For Jupyter Notebook questions:
  - Include the required Python statements
  - Include **screenshots of the notebook output**
- Store all screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each question.

## Question 1

Considering the World database, write a SQL statement that will **display the names of countries that speak more than two official languages**, along with the **number of official languages spoken**.

- Sort the results by **number of languages**, from **most to least**.
- *Hint: There are fewer than 10 countries in the results.*

### SQL

```sql
-- SELECT 
    c.name AS country,
    COUNT(*) AS num_official_languages
FROM countrylanguage cl
JOIN country c
  ON cl.countrycode = c.code
WHERE cl.isofficial = 'T'
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
ORDER BY num_official_languages DESC;

```

## Question 2

Using **Jupyter Notebooks**, you must use the `create_engine` command to connect to your database.

After the `create_engine` command is executed, **what are the three statements required to execute the query from Question 1 and display the results in the notebook**?

### Python Code

```python
query = """
SELECT 
    c.name AS country,
    COUNT(*) AS num_official_languages
FROM countrylanguage cl
JOIN country c
  ON cl.countrycode = c.code
WHERE cl.isofficial = 'T'
GROUP BY c.name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
ORDER BY num_official_languages DESC;
"""

df_q1 = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

df_q1

```

## Question 3

Using **Jupyter Notebooks**, write the Python code needed to produce the following graph:

(The graph shows country-level results derived from the World database.)

### Python Code

```python
