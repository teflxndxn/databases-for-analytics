# Module 6 - Exercise 1: Creating a Data Warehouse
From the Operational Model to the Dimensional Model

- Name: Blessing Aganaga
- Course: Database for Analytics
- Module: 6

## Overview

In this exercise you will design a **dimensional (star schema) model** for a data warehouse based on an **operational sales database**.

- **Business process:** Customer Sales
- **Grain:** Daily sales
- **Facts to store (only):**
  - **amount** = daily sales total amount (revenue)
  - **quantity** = daily sales total quantity (units sold)

You will determine the dimensions needed to support the required analytics.

## Operational Database Summary (Source System)

Tables in the operational model include:

- `customer` (custNumber, custName, address, currBal, credLimit, repNum)
- `parts` (partNum, partDesc, category, unitsOnHand, warehouseNum, unitPrice)
- `slsrep` (repNum, repName, repAddress, totComm, commRate)
- `orders` (orderNum, orderDate, custNum)
- `orderline` (orderNum, partNum, numOrdered)

## Analytics Requirements (What the Warehouse Must Support)

Your dimensional model must support questions such as:

- How many of part number **ax12** were sold on **September 2, 1994**?
- How many of part number **ax12** did customer **124** purchase last year?
- How much did customer **124** spend last year?
- What was the **average amount spent per customer per day** during September 1994?
- What was the **average quantity sold of part ax12 per day** during September 1994?
- What was the **average daily sales** during the third quarter of 1994?
- How many **appliance** items were sold during the third quarter of 1994?
- What was the amount of revenue generated by customers in **zip code 64468** during September 1994?

## Non-Requirements (Do Not Design For These)

We do **not** care about:

- Questions about **specific orders** (order-level reporting)
- Questions about **sales reps**
- Questions about **credit limits, balances**, or other customer finance fields
- Inventory questions (warehouseNum, unitsOnHand, etc.)

---

## Key Design Constraints

- The warehouse must be a **star schema**.
- The fact table must store only:
  - `amount`
  - `quantity`
- Data must be **aggregated as necessary from the operational database before loading**.
- The grain is **daily sales** (not per order, not per orderline).

---

## Your Task

### Step 1: Design the Star Schema

Create a dimensional model that includes:

- One **fact table** (daily customer sales facts)
- Appropriate **dimension tables** (you decide which ones are necessary)

Your model must clearly show:

- Fact table name and fields
- Dimension table names and fields
- Primary keys and foreign keys
- Relationships (dimensions connect to the fact table)

---

## Deliverables

### 1) Star Schema Diagram (Required)

Create and submit a **diagram** of your star schema.

You may use any tool, such as:
- draw.io (diagrams.net)
- PowerPoint
- Google Drawings
- Lucidchart
- Hand-drawn on paper (then take a clear photo)

Save your diagram image in this repo and embed it below.

**File name suggestion:** `star-schema.png` or `star-schema.jpg`

### 2) Design Notes (Required)

In 1-2 short paragraphs, explain:

- What dimensions you chose and why
- Why your fact table grain is daily sales
- How your design supports at least 3 of the required analytics questions

#### Design Notes

#### Design Notes

I designed a star schema centered on the Customer Sales process with a fact table named FactDailySales at the grain of daily sales. Each row in the fact table represents the total sales for a specific date, customer, and part. The fact table stores only the required measures: QuantitySold (daily total quantity) and AmountSold (daily total revenue), along with foreign keys to the Date, Customer, and Part dimensions. This follows the requirement to store aggregated daily sales rather than detailed order-level data.

The dimensions I selected are DimDate, DimCustomer, and DimPart because they directly support the analytics questions in the assignment. DimDate enables analysis by day, month, quarter, and year. DimCustomer supports questions about customer spending and geographic analysis. DimPart allows analysis by product and category, such as appliance items. This design supports queries like total units of a specific part sold on a given date, how much a customer spent during a year, and total revenue for a category or time period, while avoiding unnecessary storage of orderline, order, and salesrep details as instructed.
