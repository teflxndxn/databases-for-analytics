## Instructions

- Answer each question below.
- All SQL commands **must be executed** against the World database.
- For each SQL command:
  - Include the SQL in a fenced code block
  - Include a **screenshot** showing the command and results
- Store screenshots in the `screenshots/` folder and embed them below each answer.

## Question 1

**Compare and contrast the data types used for:**
- `country.Population`
- `country.LifeExpectancy`

Why were these data types selected?
 because population is a whole-number count, while life expectancy needs decimal precision.

### Answer
```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM country
WHERE Field IN ('Population','LifeExpectancy');
```
Explanation:
country.Population is an INT → it stores whole numbers only (no decimals). Population is counted in people, so decimals don’t make sense.
country.LifeExpectancy is DECIMAL(3,1) → it stores decimal values with 1 digit after the decimal (example: 72.5). Life expectancy is commonly reported with decimal precision, so this data type supports that.
### Screenshot
_Show the table structure or DESCRIBE output._

```sql
DESCRIBE country;
```

## Question 2

**What is the data type of `country.IndepYear`?**
Why do you think this data type was selected?

### Answer
_country.IndepYear is typically a SMALLINT (and it allows NULL).

Why this was selected:
A year value doesn’t need decimals—only a whole number (ex: 1960).
SMALLINT uses less storage than INT and still covers common independence years.
It allows NULL because some countries/territories may not have an independence year (or it’s unknown/not applicable).

### Screenshot

```sql
DESCRIBE country;
```

## Question 3

**Make a case for a different data type for `country.IndepYear`.**
Explain why your proposed data type might be better in some situations.

### Answer
A reasonable alternative data type is YEAR (instead of SMALLINT).
Why YEAR might be better sometimes:
It enforces that the value is a valid year format, which improves data quality.
It makes the column meaning clearer (this is a year, not just any number).
It can be easier to work with year-based functions in some MySQL setups.

Use reasonable values for the remaining columns.

### SQL

```sql
INSERT INTO country (Code, Name, Continent, Region, Population)
VALUES ('NAR', 'Narnia', 'Europe', 'Fantasy', 1000000);
```
